Slack Bridge API is a Flask-based REST API designed for user management, email-based user search, and Slack message integration.

Currently, this API only supports querying users and sending messages to users through a Slack bot. Features such as file attachments (e.g., images), sending messages to multiple users via the bot, sending messages to a specific channel (similar to a webhook), and responding to bot commands are not yet implemented. You can continue to modify and update the API as needed to include these features.

If you find this helpful, please the "star"ðŸŒŸ to support further improvements.

## Features  

- **User Search:** Fetch user details by email or retrieve all users.  
- **Health Check:** Validate server status with a lightweight endpoint.  
- **Slack Message Integration:** Send Slack messages to `users/channels` via the Slack API.

## 5.Error Handling
The SlackBridge API uses standard HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure. Additional details are provided in the response body.

| HTTP Code | Meaning               | Example                           |
|-----------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 200       | Success               | The request was successful.       |
| 400       | Bad Request           | Invalid parameters were provided. |
| 401       | Unauthorized          | Invalid or missing token.         |

## 6.Token Generator
`token_generator.py` simplifies the creation, encryption, decryption, and validation of API tokens using `AES-GCM encryption`, ensuring high security and integrity. It is particularly useful for managing access keys with expiration and IP-based restrictions.

### Features:
- `Secure Token Management:` Generates encrypted tokens, stores them in a database, and retrieves them securely.
- `Expiration & IP Validation:` Tokens include metadata such as issuer, expiration time, and allowed IP addresses for access control.
- `AES-GCM Encryption:` Ensures confidentiality and integrity using a 32-byte passphrase key and a 12-byte nonce.

## 7.Slack Bot Scopes
- Below are the scopes required for creating a new Slack Bot.
- The list also includes optional scopes that are not necessary (e.g., files:read, files:write).
- Carefully review and grant scopes based on your specific use case and requirements.

Scopes does not allow Slackbots to send messages to arbitrary channels. To send messages to a channel, the Slackbot must be a member of the channel.

| **OAuth Scope**          | **Description**                                                                      |
